Project 5-Classic Cluedo boardgame @ Technigo Bootcamp

A simple Cluedo piece, mostly focusing on the practice of creating and manipulating arrays and objects, so I didn't put much effort into the CSS part of this project. There are three decks of clickable cards (one for weapons, one for the killer and one for the rooms) and one button that reveals the mystery.
