## Project 5 - Classic Cluedo boardgame @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019

The week 5th project was to build a simple Cluedo piece, mostly focusing on the practice of creating and manipulating arrays and objects. There are three decks of clickable cards (one for weapons, one for the killer and one for the rooms) and one button that reveals the mystery.
